# lfAPI.py Streamlining Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the `lfAPI.py` module to streamline its functionality, reduce redundancy, and improve consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. Refactored `enrich_artist_mbids` Function
- Replaced direct `requests.get` calls with `lastfm_request` function
- Improved error handling by catching `LastFMError` specifically
- Enhanced code readability with better spacing and comments

### 2. Consolidated Track Fetching Functions
- Refactored `fetch_scrobbles_since` to use `get_recent_tracks_with_progress`
- Refactored `fetch_recent` to use `get_recent_tracks_with_progress`
- Refactored `fetch_recent_tracks_all_pages` to use `get_recent_tracks_with_progress`
- This reduces code duplication and ensures consistent behavior across functions

### 3. Standardized Progress Tracking
- Updated `_paginate` function to support progress callbacks
- Added consistent progress reporting across all functions
- Ensured all functions that fetch data from Last.fm API support progress tracking

### 4. Improved Documentation
- Enhanced docstrings with more detailed parameter and return value descriptions
- Added Notes sections to explain function behavior
- Standardized docstring format across all functions

### 5. Error Handling
- Standardized error handling across functions
- Added specific handling for `LastFMError`
- Improved logging of errors

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: By consolidating track fetching functions, we've reduced redundancy and made the code more maintainable.

2. **Consistent Behavior**: All functions now use the same underlying mechanisms for pagination, error handling, and progress tracking.

3. **Better Progress Reporting**: Users now get consistent progress updates across all functions.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: More specific error handling makes debugging easier.

5. **Better Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings make the code more accessible to new developers.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing a rate limiting mechanism to avoid hitting Last.fm API limits.

2. Add more comprehensive unit tests for the refactored functions.

3. Consider implementing caching for frequently used API calls to reduce API usage.
