# Airflow with compatible SQLAlchemy version
# NOTE: Apache Airflow 3.0.1 requires SQLAlchemy<2.0,>=1.4.49
# This conflicts with the core application which requires SQLAlchemy 2.0
# When using Airflow, you'll need to create a separate virtual environment
# with SQLAlchemy 1.4.x and use the SQLAlchemy 1.4 compatible code
